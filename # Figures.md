# Figures

To create a figure, a captioned image must appear by itself in a paragraph. The Markdown syntax for a figure is a link, preceded by an exclamation point (!) and a description. 
Example: 
![This description will be the figure caption](path/to/image.png)

In order to create a figure rather than an image, there must be a description included and the figure syntax must be the only element in the paragraph, i.e., it must be surrounded by blank lines.
